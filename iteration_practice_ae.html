<p>For this practice, we are going to explore a Pokemon data set from Kaggle that appeared in a previous year as a dataset of the day (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon).</p>

Write code that will return a dataset with five number summaries of all the numeric variables. Hint: You will likely need to use the <code>reframe()</code> funciton.</li>

<p>Install the <strong>plotly</strong> package for interactive graphics. (Google it if you’d like to know more). I noticed someone had used it for a Pokemon analysis on Kaggle and thought you might like to get a taste. Below is a line of code for you to run. Explore the plot it produces. From what we’ve done with <strong>ggplot2</strong> and elsewhere, you should be able to make good sense of the code. Play around with the code to see what other interesting plots you can come up with for the <strong>pokemon</strong> data. (Note that such interactive plots can be built into Shiny web apps for truly interactive data exploration.)</p>
